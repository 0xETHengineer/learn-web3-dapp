We're going to work with some additional code libraries to perform token swaps on a Solana based DEX. This is where we will swap our first SOL for some USDC so that we can begin using the liquidation bot. We'll go over the `OrcaSwapClient` which will be used to swap SOL for SPL tokens. On devnet, we'll use the Orca SDK to swap between SOL -> ORCA -> USDC.

On mainnet, we have access to the more powerful Jupiter SDK where we can swap directly without needing to keep track of intermediate pairs. Again, the mainnet enabled code is primarily for illustration and should not be used without proper testing and understanding the inherent risks.

# üß± Building the Exchange component

Two files to be aware of here: The Exchange component `components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx` which is being rendered on the right side of the screen and the helper code for performing swaps, located in `components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts`.

You'll notice that we have already included the price feed and wallet components for this step. There are also a few new components to consider:

- A textinput for the Yield Expectation
- Buttons to place buy and sell orders into the order book
- A table component to keep the order book organized (you'll need to scroll down on the right side of the page to see it)

# üöö Importing dependencies

We went over imports earlier in the pathway, the only new ones here are the Orca and Jupiter libraries. Going forward, we will only be discussing the Orca SDK - Understandably, we do not wish to make it _too_ easy for you to potentially get rekt performing swaps on mainnet with real money. Remember, Wall-E not The Terminator üòâ.

- [`@orca-so/sdk`](https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk#orca-typescript-sdk) the Orca SDK enables us to create our `OrcaSwapClient`
- [`@jup-ag/core`](https://docs.jup.ag/jupiter-core/using-jupiter-core#usage) the Jupiter SDK enables us to create our `JupiterSwapClient`

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

import {Cluster, Connection, Keypair, PublicKey} from '@solana/web3.js';
import {Jupiter, RouteInfo, TOKEN_LIST_URL} from '@jup-ag/core';
import Decimal from 'decimal.js';
import {getOrca, Network, OrcaPoolConfig} from '@orca-so/sdk';
```

# üè¶ Associated Token Accounts

Working with SPL tokens on Solana can be tricky, but we'll go over the fundamentals quickly so you're up to speed. You can get more details from the [Solana docs on the topic](https://spl.solana.com/associated-token-account) if you're interested.

An Associated Token Account ("ATA") is an account owned by the SPL Token Program, associated with your public key. It is where SPL tokens of a specific mint address are stored and the balances can be viewed on most Solana block explorers. <solscan.io> has a tab on an account display page which will list your owned token balances.

Without going into detail, an ATA is required for the tokens we are going to be swapping. We have included functions to create and remove the ATAs for Wrapped SOL, ORCA and USDC to the `OrcaSwapClient`. Go ahead and review the other functions to learn more about how it's done. All we're doing here is using a couple of `Token` class methods, `getAssociatedTokenAddress` and `createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction`. You don't need to read the code block below unless you want to see how those functions are being used.

```typescript
// solution
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts
// ...
  async makeATA(mintPubkey: PublicKey) {
    let ata = await Token.getAssociatedTokenAddress(
      ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, // always ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
      TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, // always TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
      mintPubkey, // mint PublicKey
      this.keypair.publicKey, // owner
    );
    let tx = new Transaction().add(
      Token.createAssociatedTokenAccountInstruction(
        ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, // always ASSOCIATED_TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
        TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID, // always TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID
        mintPubkey, // mint
        ata, // ata
        this.keypair.publicKey, // owner of token account
        this.keypair.publicKey, // fee payer
      ),
    );
    console.log(`ATA for ${mintPubkey}: ${ata.toBase58()}`);
    const txHash = await this.connection.sendTransaction(tx, [this.keypair]);
    return `${transactionSolscan('devnet', txHash)}` as String;
  }
// ...
```

# üéÅ Wrapping SOL

Wrapped SOL ("wSOL") is an SPL token that is necessary to be able to swap between SOL and other SPL tokens. We'll need an ATA for wSOL to be able to send this transaction. The "Sync Native" instruction being sent to the SPL Token Program is what keeps the wSOL balance synced with the SOL balance of the ATA. Thanks to the contributors of <solanacookbook.com>! You can pass an amount and the public key of the ATA to send the SOL to as the parameters.

The function returns a <solscan.io> URL for the transaction so that details are at your fingertips.

```typescript
  async wrapSOL(amount: number, ata: PublicKey) {
    let tx = new Transaction().add(
      // Transfer SOL
      SystemProgram.transfer({
        fromPubkey: this.keypair.publicKey,
        toPubkey: ata,
        lamports: amount,
      }),
      new TransactionInstruction({
        keys: [
          {
            pubkey: ata,
            isSigner: false,
            isWritable: true,
          },
        ],
        data: Buffer.from(new Uint8Array([17])),
        programId: TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
      }),
    );
    const txHash = await this.connection.sendTransaction(tx, [
      this.keypair,
      this.keypair,
    ]);
    return `${transactionSolscan('devnet', txHash)}` as String;
  }
```

# üìà Buy & Sell Orders

We need to define what an Order looks like so that we can work with it in code. This is a data type which contains information about an order, including the tokens being swapped and the size of the order. This interface is defined in `components/protocols/pyth/lib/wallet.ts`

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/wallet.ts

// Define the interface for an Order
interface Order {
  side: 'buy' | 'sell';
  size: number;
  price: number;
  fromToken: string;
  toToken: string;
}
```

To tie it together, we need to define the interface for SPL Tokens as well as SwapResults.

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

// Token interface
export interface TokenI {
  chainId: number; // 101,
  address: string; // '8f9s1sUmzUbVZMoMh6bufMueYH1u4BJSM57RCEvuVmFp',
  symbol: string; // 'TRUE',
  name: string; // 'TrueSight',
  decimals: number; // 9,
  logoURI: string; // 'https://i.ibb.co/pKTWrwP/true.jpg',
  tags: string[]; // [ 'utility-token', 'capital-token' ]
}

// SwapResult interface
export interface SwapResult {
  inAmount: number;
  outAmount: number;
  txIds: string[];
}
```

We also need to keep track of the total worth of our assets based on the current market price, the React `useState` hook is an natural choice for this. We will also set up some more app state to handle the details of the orders. This is occurring in the `Exchange` component being displayed on the right side of the page.:

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx

// State for tracking user worth with current Market Price.
const [worth, setWorth] = useState({initial: 0, current: 0});

// yieldExpectation is the amount of EMA to trigger buy/sell signals
const [yieldExpectation, setYield] = useState<number>(0.001);
const [orderSize, setOrderSize] = useState<number>(20); // USDC
const [price, setPrice] = useState<number | undefined>(undefined);
const [symbol, setSymbol] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
const [orderBook, setOrderbook] = useState<Order[]>([]);
```

Take a look at how we can update the current worth:

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx

useEffect(() => {
  // Update the current worth each price update.
  const currentWorth = wallet?.sol_balance * price! + wallet.usdc_balance;
  setWorth({...worth, current: currentWorth});
}, [price, orderSizeUSDC, setPrice]);
```

Let's break down the `OrcaSwapClient` to understand what's actually happening on Solana when an order is executed:

```typescript
// components/protocols/pyth/lib/swap.ts

export class OrcaSwapClient {
  constructor(
    public readonly keypair: Keypair,
    public readonly connection: Connection,
  ) {}
```

The class constructor defines the `Keypair` and `Connection` as both _public_ and _readonly_. This means we can trust that this data isn't being altered midway through the function. It's a mix of best practices and defensive programming üòâ.

```typescript

  async buy(size: number): Promise<SwapResult> {
    const orca = getOrca(this.connection, Network.DEVNET);
    const orcaSolPool = orca.getPool(OrcaPoolConfig.ORCA_SOL); // Orca pool for SOL
    const solToken = orcaSolPool.getTokenB(); // SOL token
    const solAmount = new Decimal(size);
    const quote = await orcaSolPool.getQuote(solToken, solAmount);
    const orcaAmount = quote.getMinOutputAmount();
    console.log(
      `Swap ${solAmount.toString()} SOL for at least ${orcaAmount.toNumber()} ORCA`,
    );
    // orcaAmount is included because in the Orca smart contract there's a condition if the swap produces
    // less than the amount requested, the transaction will fail and the user will keep their SOL.
    const swapPayload = await orcaSolPool.swap(
      this.keypair,
      solToken,
      solAmount,
      orcaAmount,
    );

    const swapTxId = await swapPayload.execute();
    console.log('Swapped:', swapTxId, '\n');

    const orcaUSDCPool = orca.getPool(OrcaPoolConfig.ORCA_USDC);
    const orcaToken = orcaUSDCPool.getTokenA();
    console.log('orcaToken', orcaToken);
    const usdcQuote = await orcaUSDCPool.getQuote(orcaToken, orcaAmount);
    const usdcAmount = usdcQuote.getMinOutputAmount();
    const swapOrcaPayload = await orcaUSDCPool.swap(
      this.keypair,
      orcaToken,
      orcaAmount,
      usdcAmount,
    );
    console.log(
      `Swap ${orcaAmount.toString()} ORCA for at least ${usdcAmount.toNumber()} USDC`,
    );

    const swapOrcaTxId = await swapOrcaPayload.execute();
    console.log('Swapped:', swapOrcaTxId, '\n');
    return {
      txIds: [swapTxId, swapOrcaTxId],
      inAmount: solAmount.toNumber(),
      outAmount: usdcAmount.toNumber(),
    };
  }
```

The `buy` and `sell` methods are quite similar - taking a `size` parameter. In both cases, we start by getting an instance of the Orca SDK with the `getOrca` method, which gives us access to the `getPool` method. From there, we can use the `getTokenB` method to be sure we're passing the correct mint address for the SOL token to the `getQuote` method (keep in mind that `getQuote` is asynchronous and returns a Promise, so we need to `await` the result).

It's important to get a minimum output amount for the quoted swap. `getMinOutputAmount` returns the smallest amount of ORCA tokens that the user will recieve for the quoted swap, and in the case that the swap produces less than this amount the transaction will revert. This protects the user from sudden changes in liquidity and slippage. These are advanced topics we won't dive into here, but this particular pattern is quite easy to implement with the Orca SDK. Just remember to program defensively and keep your users in mind üòÄ.

We can now supply all the necessary parameters to the `swap` method on the Pool instance. The [type definitions](https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk/blob/d231754ef33d21b6a60858996cd93450807f61f3/src/public/pools/types.ts#L91) tell us what we need to know about this method. It will "Perform a swap from the input type to the other token in the pool. Fee for the transaction will be paid by the owner's wallet." The `swap` returns the transaction signature of the swap instruction. This can be sent to the Solana cluster for processing [via the `execute` method from the Orca SDK's `TransactionPayload` type](https://github.com/orca-so/typescript-sdk/blob/d231754ef33d21b6a60858996cd93450807f61f3/src/public/utils/models/instruction.ts#L25).

Both `buy` and `sell` return the same values: The transaction IDs of both swaps to and from ORCA tokens contained in an array, and the amount of tokens in and out.

# üìñ The order book

The order book is necessary to keep track of the buy and sell orders we're going to be generating. When the liquidation bot is running, orders will be happening frequently. Luckily for us, antd has a flexible table component with built in pagination so we don't even need to program that part ourselves.

We've gone ahead and added a couple of buttons to the component being rendered on the right to let you send buy and sell orders to the order book.

Before doing this on devnet, give it a try using the mock wallet! You'll be able to preview the details of an order:

- The Transactions column will contain links to view the swap transactions on the [solscan.io](https://solscan.io) block explorer
- "Side" indicates whether the order was a buy or sell
- You can easily interpret the outgoing and incoming tokens and amounts

![Mock Order](mock_orderbook.png)

Let's take a quick look at the Table in the return value of `components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx` to better understand how the order book is being rendered. The antd Table component takes an _array of objects_ for the `columns`, each of these objects has a `title`, `dataIndex` and `key` - optionally we can use the `render` method to add whatever additional React fragments we need, for example: Mapping the transaction IDs to a link pointing to the correct page on solscan.io, or changing the color of the tags we use to display the amounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Remember to wrap the return values here in [React fragments](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) (`<> </>`) to avoid trouble with rendering, since they're being rendered within an existing `<div>`!
{% endhint %}

```tsx
// components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx

# üèãÔ∏è Challenge

{% hint style="tip" %}
In `components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx`, finish implementing the RxJS `map` to determine what happens when a buy or sell signal is resolved. You must replace the instances of `undefined` to accomplish this.
{% endhint %}

**Take a few minutes to figure this out**

```typescript
//...
        Rx.map((val: number) => {
          if (val > 0) {
            // buy.
            return {undefined};
          } else if (val <= 0) {
            return {undefined};
          }
        }),
//...
```

**Need some help?** Check out these hints üëá

- Remember the `Order` object and its properties. This is what you'll need to return here
- You'll definitely want to sell SOL for USDC and buy SOL with USDC
- It's important to multiply your values by the order size

Still not sure how to do this? No problem! The solution is below so you don't get stuck.

---

# üòÖ Solution

```typescript
// solution
//...
        Rx.map((val: number) => {
          if (val > 0) {
            // buy.
            return {
              side: 'buy',
              size: val * orderSizeUSDC,
              fromToken: 'usdc',
              toToken: 'sol',
            };
          } else if (val <= 0) {
            return {
              side: 'sell',
              size: Math.abs(val) * orderSizeSOL,
              fromToken: 'sol',
              toToken: 'usdc',
            };
          }
        }),
//...
```

**What happened in the code above?**

- We use RxJS to `map` the numerical value being passed, then return an `Order` object with the appropriate values set in its properties.

---

# ‚úÖ Make sure it works

Once you've made the necessary changes to `components/protocols/pyth/components/Exchange.tsx` and saved the file, the Next.js development server will hot module reload the page automatically. You'll still need to reload the page manually for the server to update it with the changed component code. Once the page is reloaded, you can click on the "sell" and "buy" buttons to send an order of each type on devnet using Orca.

---

# üèÅ Conclusion

We learned about Associated Token Accounts and SPL tokens like Wrapped SOL. We also looked at how to use the Orca SDK by creating functions related to exchanging SPL tokens.
